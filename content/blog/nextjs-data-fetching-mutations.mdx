## Prerequisites

This article assumes you are comfortable with React and are familiar with Next.js and the basics of the App Router.

## What's different about Next.js?

It's first important to understand what Next.js offers compared to other frameworks. Next.js offers 
many cutting edge features that are brand new and confusing to many developers, including me. These features include:

- Server Components - data fetching
- Server Actions - data mutations

<Callout type="warning">
Server Components were introduced in Next.js version 13, and Server Actions were introduced in 
version 14. Based on the version of Next.js you are using, certain features may not be available.

## Data Fetching

### What are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that are exclusively run on the server. Server Components
bring many benefits to the table, including:
- **Data Fetching and Performance** - Data fetching can be done in a server component, which makes data fetching more efficient and reduces the number of operations that the client needs to perform
- **Security** - All sensitive data is exposed to the server, which makes it harder for an attacker to exploit your application
- **Developer Experience** - Server Components make data fetching and rendering much easier to manage for a developer, which will be seen later in the article
- **SEO** - Since the server sends strictly HTML to the client, search engines can index pages faster and more accurately

By default, all Next.js components are server components. To make a client component, you can add a
`'Use Client'` directive to the top of the file. This will tell Next.js to render the page or component
on the client. This is useful for pages that will need to use any client-side functionality, such as:

- React hooks such as `useState` or `useEffect`
- Calls to `window` or `document` objects, or any other browser APIs
- Event handlers such as `onClick` or `onChange`

In general, you should only use client components when they are needed, as they easily interweave with server components on a page.

## Data fetching using Server Components

With Server Components, data fetching has never been easier. Here's a quick example of how to fetch data in a server component

```js showLineNumbers /async/ {5}
// page.tsx
import { fetchData } from '@/data/example'

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData()

  return (
    // use the data in the page...
  )
}
```
All you have to do is mark the function as 'async' and then make any database calls. 
And because of Next.js's built in caching, the page will be saved until the cache is invalidated, 
reducing duplicate data fetches.

<Callout>
`fetchData` is a direct database call, and because it is a server component, no database secrets are exposed to the client.
</Callout>


Another example of a data fetching function is shown below, and it is made of snippets from the [SweetBeasts Source Code](https://github.com/AgrawalVi/sweetbeasts)

```js showLineNumbers \async\ \Suspense\ {10-12}
// account/orders/page.tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import OrderPageSkeleton from '@/components/general/orders/order-page-skeleton'
import OrderPageContent from '@/components/general/orders/order-page-content'

export default function OrderPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Your Orders</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<OrderPageSkeleton />}>
        <OrderPageContent />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  )
}

// components/general/orders/order-page-content.tsx
import { getAllOrdersByUser } from '@/data/orders'
import { currentUser } from '@/lub/auth'

export default async function OrderPageContent() {
  const user = await currentUser()
  const orders = await getAllOrdersByUser(user.id)

  return (
    // render the orders here...
  )
}
```
With this example, we are using a React Suspense boundary to show a skeleton (OrderPageSkeleton) while the data is being 
fetched. This improves the user experience as the page instantly loads with a loading state to indicate that data is being fetched.

These examples are just a small taste of what you can do with server components. When you need to fetch data in a client component, 
a simple approach is to fetch the data in a server component and pass it as a prop to a client component. An example of this is shown below:

```js showLineNumbers {8}
// server-component.tsx
import { fetchData } from '@/data/example'

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData()

  return (
    <ClientComponent initialData={data} />
  )
}

// client-component.tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function ClientComponent( {initialData}: { initialData: any }) {
  const [initialData, setInitialData] = useState(initialData)

  return (
    // use the data in the client component...
  )
}
```
This approach is useful for when you need to fetch data in a client component, as it is very
straightforward with only a few lines of code.

Overall, server components are a great way to fetch data in a Next.js application, and it is worth using them
in future projects as they are a great way to improve the developer and user experience.

## Data Mutations

### Server Actions

Server Actions are much more straightforward than server components. Server Actions are POST endpoints
generated at build time. Compared to a normal API route, they are much easier to use and heavily
increase the developer experience by adding end to end type safety. Server Actions can be defined with 
a `'Use Server'` directive at the top of the file. This will tell
Next.js to create a POST endpoint for any function exported from the file.

<Callout type="danger">
  Since all server actions are converted to POST endpoints, they will be accessibly publicly, so be 
  sure to secure them with any authorization as you would for any other API route. For more information, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdKcbyEK66M)
