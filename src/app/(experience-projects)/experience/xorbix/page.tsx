                  After starting this internship, and now as I approach its
                  conclusion, I have gained profound insights into the
                  application of Computer Science in real-world scenarios.
                  Initially, I was struck by how little I knew, coming into this
                  role with limited practical experience beyond academic
                  coursework and personal projects. Throughout this journey, I
                  have learned that the most vital tool for a Software Engineer
                  is not just technical skill, but the ability to learn quickly
                  and maintain a positive, supportive attitude. This internship
                  has been immensely enjoyable and incredibly enriching. As it
                  draws to a close, I find myself excited and eager for the next
                  opportunity to continue my professional growth.
